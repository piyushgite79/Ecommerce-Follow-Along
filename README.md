# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
# MERN E-Commerce Application

Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1! This project will guide you through building a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This README outlines the core concepts, learning goals, and project setup to help you navigate through the development process.

---

## Project Description
The MERN E-Commerce Application is a hands-on project designed to teach you how to build a scalable and functional e-commerce platform using the MERN stack. You will learn to develop a secure backend, design a dynamic frontend, and implement essential features like user authentication, product management, and order processing. This project is ideal for developers aiming to gain practical experience in full-stack development.

## Learning Goals 🎯
After completing this project, you will:

- Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learn foundational steps for setting up a new project.
- Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
- Prepare for upcoming milestones by setting up the project repository.

## Key Features of the Project

### MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies for building full-stack web applications. Its JavaScript-only approach simplifies development by allowing developers to use a single language across the frontend and backend.

### REST API Creation
- Build scalable APIs to handle:
  - User Authentication: Register and log in users.
  - Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
  - Order Handling: Manage customer orders.
- Serve data in a structured JSON format.

### Authentication
- Implement secure login and registration functionalities.

### Database Schema Design
- Define structured data models using MongoDB.

### Backend Development
- Set up robust server-side logic using Node.js and Express.

### Frontend Development
- Build the frontend using React.

### Core Concepts Covered

#### Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack simplifies development by enabling:
- A JavaScript-only approach for both frontend and backend.
- A streamlined development process, especially for beginners.

#### REST API Structure and Endpoints
Learn to build REST APIs that:
- Facilitate communication between the client and server using standard HTTP methods.
- Handle tasks like user authentication, product management, and order handling.

#### Basics of Database Schema Design
In MongoDB:
- Schema design involves defining the structure and relationships of data stored in the database.

#### Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Authentication ensures secure access by verifying user identity. For this application:
- Users must authenticate before making purchases or accessing sensitive information.
